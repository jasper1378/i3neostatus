i3neostatus is a replacement for i3status that provides a way to display a status line on bars that support the i3bar protocol. Unlike i3status, the design of i3neostatus emphasizes support for third-party modules and asynchronous updates. i3neostatus aims to posses full feature parity with i3status (and then some) while maintaining a high degree of efficiency.
